I’ve also strongly recommended that you favor automatic configuration as much as
possible to avoid the maintenance costs involved with explicit configuration.
But when you must explicitly configure Spring, you should favor Java-based configuration—
which is more powerful, type-safe, and refactorable—over XML configuration. This
preference will guide my choice of wiring techniques as I present the examples
throughout this book

vậy tóm lại nên dùng tự động config (implicit), nếu dùng explicit config thì dùng kiểu Java-based configuration
